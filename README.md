# AI Roadtrip Planner
#### Video Demo:  <URL [HERE](https://youtu.be/VLsbMvWJtWQ)>
#### Description:
The software allows you to plan a road trip in between 2 cities by defining the number of stops, preferred activities and time you have available. It then does call the ChatGPT API by passing your input (start city, destination city, time, stops etc.) to the API to fetch back data about your desired trips and must-have stops. You can create an account in order to save your planned road trips and easily access them again. When you create an account you can log in to find back any roadtrips you've planned in the past.

#### Changes:
A valid OpenAI API key is required to run the AI roadtrip planner. The API key should be provided in app.py and ~/app/actions/planTrip.ts
